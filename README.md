A unique calculator designed to take in only your weight (in kg or lbs) and bodyfat percentage and calculate your daily macros (protein, fats and carbs) based off the ideal macros for weight gain and weight loss. It has the included option to factor in cardio sessions, but assumes you weight train in the gym 5-6x a week for 45-120 minutes. For accurate results, do not estimate anything.
